Alcohol variables:
- Drink today (binary)
- Drink yesterday (binary)
- How many drinks per day (character)
- Blood alcohol content (numeric)

Computed alcohol variables:
- Drinker (binary)
- Alcohol frequency (categorical)

Variable drinker includes 158 individuals. For dead individuals, those whose cause of death mentioned 'alcohol' are treated as drinkers and 
all other deaths are treated as non-drinkers (the "conservative" approach). For alive individuals, all those whose answer to any of the alcohol variables 
is not positive (yes/a number of drinks per day/BAC). 

Variable alcohol frequency is a categorized version of 'how many drinks per day' and includes 113 individuals, all who are currently alive. For dead
individuals, the information is not available. The levels of the variable include: 0, 'one or less', 'two or less', 'three or less', 'four or less', and
'more than four', a.k.a. <1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4+. Despite the naming of the levels, they are not cumulative. 

A Basta was performed using both these variables as covariates separately. The basta model with alcohol frequency as covariate did not converge,
likely because it does not include any individuals who have died as the model does not accept NAs in its covariates. 

The basta model with drinker as covariate converges and gives drinkers a lower life estimate than non-drinkers by about 15 years. Drinkers' survival curve
is also shaped differently and falls more quickly than the non-drinkers curve. Lastly, drinkers seemt o have less variation compared to non-drinkers in
age-specific survival and mortality. 

NOTE: these two models have both been ran with the model in which all dead people who died between 2015-2017 are assumed to have died in 2015, because
using this dataset in thre previous model led to convergence. 

NOTE: some individuals are born and die in the same year. Due to the model, they have to be changed. As such, their death year is extended with + 1 and
as a result they then have 1 data point. For example, I am born in 2020 February and die in November. In the dataset, I am born in November and captured
in 2021. So I will have 1 data point in 2021. This is because basta does not accept recaptures in the same year as the birth year.
