Alcohol variables:
- Drink today (binary)
- Drink yesterday (binary)
- How many drinks per day (character)
- Blood alcohol content (numeric)

Computed alcohol variables:
- Drinker (binary)
- Alcohol frequency (categorical)

Variable drinker includes 158 individuals. For dead individuals, those whose cause of death mentioned 'alcohol' are treated as drinkers and 
all other deaths are treated as non-drinkers (the "conservative" approach). For alive individuals, all those whose answer to any of the alcohol variables 
is not positive (yes/a number of drinks per day/BAC). 

Variable alcohol frequency is a categorized version of 'how many drinks per day' and includes 113 individuals, all who are currently alive. For dead
individuals, the information is not available. The levels of the variable include: 0, 'one or less', 'two or less', 'three or less', 'four or less', and
'more than four', a.k.a. 0, <1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4+. Despite the naming of the levels, they are not cumulative. 

A Basta was performed using both these variables as covariates separately. The basta model with alcohol frequency as covariate did not converge,
likely because it does not include any individuals who have died as the model does not accept NAs in its covariates. 

The basta model with drinker as covariate converges and gives drinkers a lower life estimate than non-drinkers by about 15 years. Drinkers' survival curve
is also shaped differently and falls more quickly than the non-drinkers curve. Lastly, drinkers seemt o have less variation compared to non-drinkers in
age-specific survival and mortality. 

NOTE: these two models have both been ran with the model in which all dead people who died between 2015-2017 are assumed to have died in 2015, because
using this dataset in thre previous model led to convergence. 

NOTE: some individuals are born and die in the same year. Due to the model, they have to be changed. As such, their death year is extended with + 1 and
as a result they then have 1 data point. For example, I am born in 2020 February and die in November. In the dataset, I am born in November and captured
in 2021. So I will have 1 data point in 2021. This is because basta does not accept recaptures in the same year as the birth year.

I updated the model with alcohol frequency. Firstly, I performed another permutation test to create a new sample with randomly distributed death years 
for all 14 individuals who died between 2014 and 2018. Using this sample I re-performed the model, again with only individuals alive as only those gave
the necessary information. This model included 113 individuals and a covariate with 6 levels as before. The model converged and accurately shows a higher
probability of survival for individuals who drink less and a higher mortality for those who drink more. The y-axis for the mortality curve goes up to 3 -
what does this mean? The x-axis for both also goes up to 150 years. Is this because there is not enough death data?

Mean/max/min birth years for the categories:
0 per day: 1999 / 2018 / 1931
One or less: 2001 / 2017 / 1955
Two or less: 1999 / 2017 / 1959
Three or less: 1982 / 2009 / 1940
Four or less: 1982 / 2006 / 1959
More than four: 1984 / 1999 / 1960

So, there is somewhat of an age-specific effect > you can split the categories in 2 >  Two or less are all younger on average & more than two are older. 
Is this what is creating the curve? The fact that younger individuals are drinking less?

Model to examine parents' drinking behaviour as covariate will not work well for the following reasons:
- None of the children under 15 have parents who dont drink, apart from 1 individual who is dead (and classified as 'non-drinker' because he did not die
of alcohol) and 1 individual who is alive and who has been observed drinking (but by us, so not a valid data point). 
- All covariates being equal wont lead to a good model 
- Drinking behaviour by parents in frequency will be skewed as not all individuals have two known parents. 
- How to construct a potential composite measure? > sum of both parents' drinking frequency?
- Composite measure based on frequency only gives info for parents who are alive both > will give a biased and smaller sample

So, how can we look at parents' drinking frequency as an influential factor for childrens drinking?

Chisquare test of independence? 
Since we have two categorical variables (child alive/not alive & drinking frequency in cats), we can perform the
chi2 test. However, when looking closer at the data we have a few missing values. These inhibit us from actually performing the test, since "If x is a 
matrix with at least two rows and columns, it is taken as a two-dimensional contingency table: the entries of x must be non-negative integers. 
Otherwise, x and y must be vectors or factors of the same length; cases with missing values are removed, the objects are coerced to factors, and the 
contingency table is computed from these." >>> So, with missing values not possible. However, deleting them will also delete important info, can't do that.

Regression analysis?
Again, the issue of missing values > trade-off: less data to include or no analysis?
